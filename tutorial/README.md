Tutorial examples for different reconstruction algorithms can be found in [tutorial](https://github.com/openspyrit/spyrit-examples/blob/master/tutorials/tutorial).

## DCDRUNET : Data completion with pretrained DRUNet denoising
- tuto_core_2d_short_drunet.ipynb: This tutorial shows how to simulate data and perform image reconstruction with spyrit toolbox for 2D single-pixel imaging. In specific with DCRUNET that leverages the pretrained DRUNet denoising network.
