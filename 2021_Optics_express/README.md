# Get the scripts

Clone the repo and navigate to the folder that corresponds to this study

```shell
git clone https://github.com/openspyrit/spyrit-examples.git
cd ./spyrit-examples/2021_Optics_express/
```

This folder contains two script

* main.py:  generates the figures in the paper  (typically run in Spyder). It requires trained networks.
* train.py: can be used to train the reconstruction networks (typically run in a terminal)

# Install the dependencies

Our scripts primarily relies on the [SPyRiT ](https://github.com/openspyrit/spyrit) package that can be installed via `pip`. We recommend creating a virtual (e.g., conda) environment first.

NB: On Windows, you need to install [torch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) before SPyRiT.

```shell
# conda (or pip) install
conda create --name spyrit-env
conda activate spyrit-env
conda install -c anaconda spyder 
conda install -c anaconda pip
# for windows only
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch

# pip install
pip install spyrit # tested with spyrit==1.1.0
pip install pylops
```

# Experimental data

We exploit some of the single-pixel raw acquisitions that constitute the [SPIHIM](https://github.com/openspyrit/spihim) dataset. The preprocessed data considered in the paper can be downloaded [here](https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/~ducros/spyritexamples/2021_OpticsExpress/expe.zip). Unzip in `./spyrit-examples/2021_Optics_express/expe/`. 

# Trained neural networks

We provide the trained network [here](https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/~ducros/spyritexamples/2021_OpticsExpress/model.zip). Unzip in `./spyrit-examples/2021_Optics_express/model/`. 

# Training the neural networks from scratch [check]

### Type of networks

We provide `train.py` to train several variants of networks, from a single command line. This includes

* DC-Net: Denoised Completion (Tikhonov) network

```shell
python train.py
```

* C-Net: Completion network (DC-Net with no denoising)

```shell
python train.py --denoi 0
```

* Free-Net. This is a C-Net where the completion layer is learnt (i.e., free during training)

```shell
python train.py --denoi 0 --net_arch 3
```

* Noiseless-Net. This is a C-Net trained with no noise.

```shell
python train.py --denoi 0 --intensity_max None
```

By default, all networks are trained for M = 512 measurements during 20 epochs. For other values, consider

```shell
python train.py --denoi 1 --CR 1024 --num_epochs 100
```

### Image database

We train our networks by simulating single-pixel measurements from the STL-10 image database. Running the above command lines will download the database. 

[optional] If you already have the STL-10 on your computer, create a symbolic link.

* Linux: [CHECK]

```shell
ln -s <stl-10 parent folder> /data/ 
```

* Windows Powershell:

``` powershell
New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Name \data\ -Target <stl-10 parent folder>
```
