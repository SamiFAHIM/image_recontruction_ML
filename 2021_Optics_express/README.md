# Single-pixel image reconstruction from experimental data using neural networks 

This repository contains the code related to the paper `Antonio Lorente Mur, Pierre Leclerc, Fran√ßoise Peyrin, and Nicolas Ducros, "Single-pixel image reconstruction from experimental data using neural networks," Opt. Express 29, 17097-17110 (2021)` [https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.424228](https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.424228).

# Dependencies and installation

This code is functionnal with the V1.0 of spyrit (and all it's following dependencies). It also uses the data from spihim.

# Downloading Data and trained neural networks

## Downloading Spihim experimental data
```
